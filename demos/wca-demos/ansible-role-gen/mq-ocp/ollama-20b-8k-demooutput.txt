                port:
                  targetPort: amqps

This playbook first creates a project named "ibm-mq" and deploys the IBM
MQ operator using a Kubernetes deployment object. Then, it creates an IBM
MQ custom resource using a Kubernetes object. Finally, it exposes the IBM
MQ route using a Kubernetes Route object.

>>> Question: Recommend ways to parameterize this playbook.
There are multiple ways to parameterize this playbook, such as:

1. Use variables in the playbook's inventory file or extra-vars file to
specify the project name, operator image, queue manager name, etc.

2. Use Jinja templates to dynamically generate the Kubernetes objects
based on certain parameters. For example, you could create a template for
the IBM MQ custom resource and use a Jinja template variable to set the
queue manager name.

3. Use Ansible roles to modularize and parameterize the playbook tasks.
This allows you to define reusable roles that can be customized with
different parameters.

Overall, there are multiple ways to achieve parameterization in Ansible
playbooks, depending on your specific requirements and preferences.

>>> Write the same playbook using recommended parameters.
Here's an example of how we could modify the previous playbook to use
variables for some of its parameters:

In this version, we've defined variables for the project name, operator
image, and queue manager name. These variables can be set in a playbook
inventory file or extra-vars file, allowing you to customize the
deployment without modifying the playbook code itself. We've also used
Jinja templates to dynamically generate thequeue manager name in the
custom resource definition.

>>> Write defaults/main.yml with the default values for use in an Ansible role.
...
Here's an example of how we could create adefaults/main.yml file for an
Ansible role that deploys IBM MQ on OpenShift:

    ---
    project_name: ibm-mq
    operator_image: quay.io/ibm-messaging/mq-operator:latest
    queue_manager_name: myqueuemanager

This file defines default values for the project name, operator image,
and queue manager name that can be used by any playbook or role that
includes this role. For example, if you want to deploy IBM MQ with a
different project name, you can set theproject_name variable in your
playbook or inventory file:

    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      roles:
        - ibm_mq
      vars:
        project_name: my-other-project

>>> Write meta/main.yml with the metadata for use in an Ansible role.
Here's an example of how we could create a meta/main.yml file for an
Ansible role that deploys IBM MQ on OpenShift:

any dependencies that this role has.

>>> Write README.md with the summary, prerequisites, additional ansible collect

Here's an example of how we could create a README.md file for an Ansible
role that deploys IBM MQ on OpenShift:

    # IBM MQ deployment on OpenShift
    Deploy IBM MQ on OpenShift with this Ansible role.

    ## Summary

    This Ansible role installs and configures IBM MQ on Red Hat OpenShift
Container Platform. It creates the necessary custom resource definitions
and templates for deploying IBM MQ using the operator-sdk tool. The role
can be used to deploy IBM MQ in a development or production environment.

    ## Prerequisites

    1. OpenShift Container Platform 4.6 or later
    2. Ansible 2.10 or later

    ## Additional ansible collections

    - ibm.cloud collection: https://galaxy.ansible.com/ibm/cloud

    ## Task explanations

    - Create project: Creates a new OpenShift project for deploying IBM
MQ.
    - Deploy IBM MQ operator: Deploys the IBM MQ operator from the
quay.io container registry.
    - Create IBM MQ custom resource: Creates an IBM MQ custom resource
using the Kubernetes API. This defines the queue manager and its
configuration.
    - Expose IBM MQ route: Exposes the IBM MQ queue manager as a route,
which can be used to access it externally.

    ## Variable explanations

    - project_name: The name of the OpenShift project to deploy IBM MQ
into (default: ibm-mq).
    - operator_image: The container image for the IBM MQ operator
(default: quay.io/ibm-messaging/mq-operator:latest).
    - queue_manager_name: The name of the IBM MQ queue manager to create
(default: myqueuemanager).
