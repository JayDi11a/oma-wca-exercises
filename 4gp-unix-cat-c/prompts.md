# prompts.md

## Synopsis

Contains natural language prompts to use for a demonstration of ollama, IBM Granite.Code, and/or IBM watsonx Code Assistant.

## Prerequisites

- IBM watsonx Code Assistant extension for Microsoft VS Code

The installation of these prerequisites are covered elsewhere.

In ollama, I used `granite-code:8b` on an M1 Pro-based MacBook, e.g., `ollama run granite-code:8b`.

## To Do

- Test this with `granite-code:20b`
- Test this with `granite3.2`

## Prompts

- You are a C programmer. Implement the UNIX "cat" command.
- Explain the code.
- Generate unit tests.
- How do I compile this code?
- How do I install gcc on macOS?

## Sample results

See [`sample-results.md`](./sample-results) in this folder for sample output you can use as a reference for both preparing for and giving the demo.
